    /// <br/><br/>
    /// A generic pool for pre-loading a certain number
    /// of copies of a single prefab in <see cref="TemplateObject"/>.
    /// This is especially useful when using a large amount 
    /// of game objects such as physically accurate bullets.
    /// Instead of creating a bullet every time it is fired,
    /// which might cause a drop in fps, it is more efficient
    /// to load a number of bullets at the beginning of the
    /// scene and reuse already fired bullets.
    /// <br/><br/>
    /// In order to reuse items the passed prefab must have a
    /// component that extends <see cref="Reusable"/>. When an
    /// item is ready to be reused, you must manually call
    /// <see cref="Reusable.FreeForReuse()"/>. When acquiring
    /// an item from the pool, items for that
    /// <code>gameObject.activeSelf</code> holds true are
    /// preferred to objects that are still active. The reason
    /// for this is that for example fired bullets may stay on
    /// the ground and only be despawned and reused on demand.
    /// The fact that marking for reuse and resetting the
    /// object's state have their entirely own mechanisms
    /// makes this pool implementation as generic as possible.
    /// <br/><br/>
    /// You can set the <see cref="Template"/> and <see cref="Capacity"/>
    /// either in the inspector or in a script. By default, a pool is
    /// <b>lazily instantiated</b>. No items are instantiated until
    /// either <see cref="Init"/> is called manually, or the first
    /// item is requested. <i>You can override this behaviour by
    /// setting <see cref="InitOnSceneStart"/> to true in the
    /// inspector.</i> Any changes to either <see cref="Template"/>
    /// or <see cref="Capacity"/> will be rejected with a warning
    /// after initialization. 
    /// <br/><br/>
    /// To ensure working conditions even under extreme and
    /// unexpected circumstances, the pool behaves similar
    /// to <see cref="List{T}"/> in that it's capacity
    /// increases as soon as there are no more items available.
    /// <br/><br/>
    /// When no items are currently available for reuse, the pool
    /// calls <see cref="Reusable.ReuseRequested"/> on every managed
    /// item until one frees itself for reuse. When no items are
    /// found, the pool's capacity increases and a new item is instantiated.
    /// <br/><br/>
    /// The <see cref="GrowRate"/> field describes the percentage
    /// with which the pool's <see cref="Capacity"/> increases in
    /// size every time new items are required. When the
    /// <see cref="GrowRate"/> is set to 0, an exception is thrown
    /// instead. Once the pool's capacity increases, not all free
    /// spots are immediately filled by new items. Instead, items
    /// are created as soon as they are immediately required or else
    /// once per frame until the total number of items are equal
    /// to the pool's <see cref="Capacity"/>.
